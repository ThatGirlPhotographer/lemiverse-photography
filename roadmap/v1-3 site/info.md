# V1 Photo Portfolio Site

## Nickname: EcoPhotos/exporess-photography-site

## Created: Mid 2023

## Software used HTML/JS/CSS & mongoDB

## About:
The v1-2 sites were the first integrations of the sites to ever be made they were quite basic and had little to no functionality when created the ui consisted of 1 full page to display the whole panel and photos wich was unintuitive since i needed to upload and delete records manually from the site including uploading photos and Etc, it wasnt until V3 that the first admin panel was introduced but the admin panel had no styling due to a bug within its system which made it not like my css correctly some of the major issues with the sites were it was slow, the ui was basic it was put onto one page and the gallery image viewer started to lag after 3 or more photos rendering photos too slowly and exiting it was even slower.

## Positives:
it worked
its css was good and built the inspiration framework for the future sites

# Cons:
Slow
all info and stuff put into one page
not mobile responsive 
had many bugs 

# Notes:

the site was very much rushed and built in around 3 days for the first build and the 2nd fixed a few issues but brought new ones and 3rd took around 2 weeks and brought even more issues

it was later on ditched but used as inspiration idea for the v4 site, images of it are unavailable atm.
