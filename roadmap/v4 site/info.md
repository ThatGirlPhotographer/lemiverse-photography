# V4 Photo Portfolio Site

## Nickname: Photo Portfolio V4

## Created: Early 2024

## Software used EJS/CSS/NODEJS/JS & SQLITE

## About:
the V4 site was started in early 2024 as an alternative to fix the issues with the unrealed v1-3 sites, this version would later on be the Default UI for V5 and include a newer black and white design that stood out to me. black and white are easy too see colours for me due to me being partially colorblind and not being able too see much red and with this version it included multiple pages including: gallery, about, contact etc but the site nearly escaped the css issue from the last site for the admin panel but wasnt quite there yet, although image loading/rendering was a bit faster it was not enough yet since i used a public photography site template and tried to port it whilst maintaining its origianl looks to my branding and that was my worse mistake due to asking for help/tweaks on bits from others to only find out something new broke for example the gallery layout i wanted to be nice and sleek and cool looking but just couldnt get it working so i asked a friend and he fixed it.


## Positives:
Layed out the idea looks for the v5 site
fixed loading slightly
was somewhat mobile responsive but not fully
used multiple pages instead of 1

## Cons:
had some bugs in admin panel and DB
still somewhat had image rendering issues and would start to lag after 10 or more photos 
DB later on broke when doing upgrades to it.

## Notes 
Finalklised the UI style i wanted in the V5 website and allowed me to learn some new bits whilst coding and try and learn on what i need to fix

spent 2-4 months working on it instead og rushing it for a few days to weeks but left it for most of the year sitting in my files due to not being motivated to fix it due to a burnout.
